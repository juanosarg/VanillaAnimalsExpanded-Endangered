	<description>Remember how I said the Temperate animals mod was the last one? Well, people lie. There is still a few animals around the world that we did not yet make into actual RimWorld animals - and this time we have decided to also raise awareness of the big issue in our world - endangered species and animal conservation.

From pandas and pangolins to already extinct tasmanian tigers and quaggas, you can now help with animal conservation in RimWorld. These animals, just like in our world, are endangered, and don’t appear naturally on the map. Instead, they can arrive in a rare ‘Endangered animals wander in’ event, giving you a chance to tame them and breed them. Releasing them to repopulate their species - which is a new option added by this mod - allows you to gain relations with other factions too!

Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Endangered biome expansion. It adds 11 new animals that will spawn as part of a new event. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.
